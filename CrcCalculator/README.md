Project: CRC Calculator (GUI)

Feature Focus: Algorithms, Bitwise Ops, GUI, MVVM & Event-Driven Design Pattern

Description: Desktop GUI tool to compute CRC checksums for text and files. Provides presets for CRC-8/16/32/64, custom polynomial/width/init, reflect in/out, xor-out, live recalculation as you type, hex/bin views, drag-and-drop files, streaming for large inputs with progress/cancel, and import/export of CRC profiles.

Skills Gained: Bit manipulation, table-driven CRC, constexpr/templates, GUI architecture (MVVM), event handling/signals/slots, threading for file I/O, state management, unit/integration/acceptance test
