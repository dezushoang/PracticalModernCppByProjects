Project: Serial Port Monitor 

Feature Focus: Embedded 

Description: Live MCU sensor data over UART, plotted in GUI. 

Skills Gained: Serial comms, parsing, charting

Key C++23 Features to Use
std::expected<T, E> for robust error handling in serial and parsing modules

std::generator for streaming parsed data to the GUI

Ranges and views for elegant data filtering and transformation

Chrono formatting for timestamped data display

Modules (optional) for cleaner code organization
