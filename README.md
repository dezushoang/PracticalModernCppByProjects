# Practical Modern C++ by Project

Welcome to **Practical Modern C++ by Project** — a hands-on journey through the power and elegance of **C++23**, built for experienced developers who want to modernize their C++ skills through real-world applications.

## Purpose

This repository is a collection of **feature-driven, GUI-based projects** that demonstrate best practices and advanced techniques in modern C++. Each project is designed to be practical, interactive, and aligned with real-world use cases.

Rather than revisiting foundational concepts, the focus is on applying **C++23 features** effectively, cleanly, and safely.

## What You'll Learn

Each project highlights key aspects of modern C++ development:

- Smart pointers, lambdas, ranges, and coroutines
- Asynchronous programming with coroutines
- Memory safety, RAII, and defensive coding
- Advanced STL and algorithm usage
- GUI development for user interaction
- Clean architecture and maintainable codebases

## Project Structure

The project shall include many sub-projects. Each Projects are organized by theme and complexity. Each folder contains:

- Source code with clear structure
- README with project-specific goals and feature highlights
- Build instructions (using CMake)
- Screenshots or demos (where applicable)

## Tools & Technologies

- **C++23**
- **CMake** for build configuration
- **Cross-platform GUI frameworks** (e.g. Qt, ImGui, or others)
- **Unit testing** (e.g. Catch2 or Google Test)
- Optional: **CI/CD integration**, **static analysis**, and **code formatting**
- **Docker** for containerization and reproducible development environments

## Why This Project?

There are many C++ tutorials—but few that focus on **modern idioms**, **real applications**, and **best practices**. This project bridges that gap by:

- Demonstrating **how** and **why** to use modern features
- Building **complete applications**, not just snippets
- Encouraging clean, safe, and maintainable code

## Work in Progress

This is an evolving project. New applications and features will be added regularly. Stay tuned and feel free to contribute!
